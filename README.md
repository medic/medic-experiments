# Experiments

This repository contains various proof-of-concept, testing, and performance analysis scripts
for Medic Mobile's platform.

Each set of related scripts/tools should be placed in its own top-level directory. Each
directory should be given a human-interpretable dash-separated "slug" for a name, like
`replication-performance-v0.6` or `security-fuzzing-v0.4`. Each top-level directory
should include a Markdown-formatted `README.md` describing the tools available in that
directory, the purpose of each tool, and how to run each tool.
